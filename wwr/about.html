        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>Founded in 1995, RiverPulse Rafting began as a small family venture nestled along the banks of the roaring Colorado River. Inspired by a love for nature and a passion for adventure, the company was born to provide thrilling whitewater experiences while fostering a deep respect for the environment.
          In the 1990s further innovation took place with the invention of self-bailing rafts in which precisely located holes in the raft release excess water. This is one of the fundamental developments in the sport as it meant no additional weight or sagging in the raft, as well as no longer having to manually bail water, especially relevant on more challenging or longer runs. Added safety measures like helmets and lifejackets, as well as lightweight paddles have solidified the sport as a great activity for adventure seekers and families alike.
